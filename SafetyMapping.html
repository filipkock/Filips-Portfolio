                WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT?
            </h2>
            <p class="p2white">  
                Vehicle companies are amazing at developing different features for their vehicle's. Features from seat heaters all the way to automatic breaks. This gives the customer many options to choose from when ordering a vehicle. But what happens once these features are developed? <span class="bolded">How well do the features actually perform on the market?</span> 
            </p>
            <p class="p2white">
                I had the opportunity to improve the tool that visualised this problem. I was responsible for the design and development of an interactive report in Microsoft Power BI.

            <p class="p2dark">By talking to our stakeholders, I could determine that the users wanted an easier way to get information about the vehicles and the features penetration rate. According to the stakeholders, some of the major pain points with the previous version of tool was its many complications and limitations.</p>

            <p class="p2white">To get a deeper understanding of what needs to be improved <span class="bolded">it is important to ask the right questions.</span> To help clarify this, I decided to create a list that summarized the projects general objectives into a list of “how can we” questions.</p>

            <p class="p2white">It is important to know who our users are, as well as their needs, before starting to design and develop the tool. As the end-users of this tool mainly would be our stakeholders, and other members of their team, it was easy to discuss the issues with them to get a better understanding of the problem. This was done by going through the previous tools design and discussing its difficulties.</p>

            <h2 class="rubrik p1white">INFORMATION ARCHTECTURE </h2>

            <p class="p2white">One of the major flaws with the previous design was its information architecture. Because of my background in cognitive science, I could clearly see <span class="bolded">the lack of consideration of cognitive psychology and how the human mind processes information.</span> For that reason, I tried to structure the content so that it is was easier for the users to navigate and find relevant information.</p>

            <p class="p2white"><span class="bolded">Mental models</span> are simple representation in the human mind of how different things work. They are pre-existing assumptions people have in their mind before interacting with the world. It is therefore important to design so that the products are adjusted to the users beliefs and assumptions to make the experience easy and straightforward. By interviewing and asking the users questions related to the designs structure I could better understand their mental models of the product. With this I for example created a navigation that structure the relevant information on to different pages.</p>

The list divides feature inside the tool that exist but should be improved and feature that don't exist but should be added.

            <h2 class="rubrik p1dark">Developing the tool</h2>

            <p class="p2dark">One of the more time-consuming part of the project was the development of the tool. To convert the design from a visual prototype to a functioning report led to many challenges and complications. Because Power BI for example had a limited python integration it also led to compromises such as not being fully automatic when updating the data. But even if there where compromises the new version of the tool had many improvements and all points in the requirement specifications were fulfilled.</p>

            <h3 class="underrubrik p2dark headermargin">Testing</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">During development demo versions where shared with the stakeholders to provide feedback to the report. User testing was also conducted and was in the form of the "think aloud" method. The user was given a specific task while recommended to “think out loud” when using the prototype. This was to draw attention to the customer's user experience and shortcomings of the tool. Changes made were for example creating an overview page, adding certain feature descriptions and changing the presentation of certain visuals.</p>

            <p class="p2dark">The final product was an interactable report that could be shared, in the form of an app, throughout the company's communication pages. This to easy be able to see how well different safety features for the vehicles preformed on the market.</p>

            <h2 class="rubrik p1dark">My Final thoughts</h2>

            <p class="p2dark">The new version led to many improvements and our stakeholders where happy with the results. However, there are still many improvements that could be made. For example, it would be good if the user could filter more general areas. Another improvement could be to make the report more adapted for specific users where the report shows information relevant to the current user. But for now these will be left as “future improvements”. </p>
