                PROBLEM Statement
            </h2>
            <p class="p2white">  
                YiLi, a Gothenburg-based restaurant renowned for its authentic Chinese cuisine, is seeking to improve its online ordering experience. Despite offering catering and takeout services via telephone, YiLi's current non-responsive website is a barrier to online ordering. To enhance the customer experience, the project aims to redesign their website to a responsive website that allows online ordering.

            </h2>

            <p id= "designprocessmargin" class="p2dark">Using a user-centered approach, the design process included five-stages: understand, define, ideate, design, and test. User research was conducted to identify customer needs and pain points. Ideas were generated and tested through wireframes and prototypes, followed by iterative improvements based on user feedback. The final result was a responsive website with an improved online ordering experience for YiLi's customers.</p>

            <p class="p2dark">To create a strong foundation for our work, conducting user research is a crucial step to understanding the problem and finding the right solutions. In order to ensure that our research is thorough and effective, it is important to develop a structured plan that outlines what to research and how to approach the research process.</p>

            <h3 class="underrubrik p1dark">Research objectives</h3>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Gain insights into the Asian restaurant market in Gothenburg</li>
                <li>Identify the customers and their ordering experiences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="underrubrik p1dark">Research objectives</h3>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Method 1:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market research</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Method 2</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>User interviews</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="underrubrik p1dark">Method 1: Market research</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">Understanding the market is crucial to gain insights about trends, customers, and competition, making it a vital starting point for research. This helps identify the specific focus for individual in-depth interviews and the questions to ask. The research involved online searches, reading articles and studies, and exploring various forums. For a detailed view of the market research and the sources used click <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1ZTX6hBbcbnH8yklnu37svfXOxuvx-sl5y5tBHNhZc/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a> to see the full document.</p>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Market environment and trends:</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Key point: The Chinese food market is a very popular, and growing industry, in the large number of restaurants in Sweden</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Customers demographics:</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Key point: A significant proportion of the customer base comprises of young adults, often aged 21-35, with an annual income below 20,000, indicating their high popularity within a younger demographic</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Customers Behaviour:</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Key point: Customers exhibit a positive attitude towards Chinese food, particularly in terms of health and price, and often prefer to order takeaway during night-time hours</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1dark headermargin">Provisional Persona</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">Based on the findings from our market research, I developed provisional personas to guide our focus on the target user group. Using this information, I created three personas that over-exaggerate the characteristics of potential customers who may engage with the restaurant. I used these personas to identify suitable candidates for the user interviews.</p>

            <img class="h4headermargin" src="./yiliImages/Provisional perosna (1).png" alt="Provisional persona image">

            <h3 class="p1dark underrubirk headermargin">Method 2: User Interviews</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">Once I had a basic understanding of the market and target audience it was time to understand the users deeper. To gain a more in-depth understanding of the target audience, a series of user interviews were conducted. The goal was to gain direct insights into users' needs and behaviours. The interviews were conducted with three individuals, including two males and one female, and consisted of 12 questions. The individuals were asked questions about their experiences both in-store and online, specifically related to YiLi or similar restaurants.</p>

            <h4 class="p2dark h4rubrik h4headermargin">The key takeaways that will impact the design:</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark">
                <li>Customers primarily choose restaurants based on recommendations from friends, social media, price, and most importantly, the cuisine offered.</li>
                <li>Providing clear information on the restaurant's price and cuisine is essential.</li>
                <li>Customers expect the online ordering process to be quick, easy, and straightforward, with as few steps as possible. The ordering process should be similar to other commonly used services.</li>
                <li>Clear communication of the size and ingredients of dishes is essential. Incorporating images and an option to "read more" for each dish can enhance the user experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="definesection">
        <div class="safetymain">
            <h2 class="rubrik p1white">2. define</h2>

            <p class="p2white">After gathering information about our users the next step was to analyse and synthesise these observations to define the core problems. Therefore I created a series of How-Might-We Questions that will help us define the problems we aim to solve.</p>

            <h3 class="underrubrik p1white headermargin">How-Might-We</h3>

            <ul class="p2white bulletlistsection">
                <li>How can we provide clear information on the restaurant's price and cuisine to make it easier for customers to make informed decisions when choosing a restaurant?</li>
                <li>How can we optimize the online ordering process for ease and efficiency to reduce frustration for customers and minimize potential loss of customers?</li>
                <li>How can we improve communication of the size and ingredients of dishes to prevent confusion and ensure satisfactory dining experiences for customers?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="underrubrik p1white headermargin">User Persona</h3>

            <p class="p2white">To keep our product human-centred during the ideation stage, personas were created based on the gathered data. These personas will help guide the development to a user-centred design solution.</p>

            <img src="./yiliImages/Adam persona (2).png" alt="User persona">

            <img src="./yiliImages/Alva persona (1).png" alt="User persona">

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1white headermargin">User Journey</h3>
            
            <p>The user journey section will outline the steps that a user takes while interacting with the restaurant. From exploring the menu to placing an order, the user journey will highlight pain points and opportunities for improvement in the website's design.</p>

        <div class="safetymain">
            <h2 class="rubrik p1dark">3. Ideate</h2>

            <p class="p2dark">Now that we have identified our users and their journey, it's time to move into the ideation phase. This is where I generated ideas with focus on solving the users pain points and needs. By exploring a variety of ideas, I can narrow down the options and begin to develop a design solution that will meet the user needs.</p>

            <h3 class="p1dark underrubirk headermargin">Information Architecture</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">The first step was to create a well-organised information architecture (IA) for the website. This is important to ensure that the users can easily navigate and find the information they need. But the IA is also important as it will serve as the foundation for the user flow and the design of the user interface.</p>

        <div class="safetymain">
            <h2 class="rubrik p1white">4. Design </h2>

            <p class="p2white">With a solid understanding of our user needs, the information architecture as well as the task & user flow, it's time to move into the design phase. In this section I will used the knowledge and insight gained from the previous stages to create an interface that aligns with our user needs and project goals.</p>

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1white headermargin">Sketching</h3>

            <p class="p2white">The first step was to explore and refine my ideas through sketching. By sketching I can conceptualise different possible solutions and easily evaluate and improve them. This way I can experiment with different layouts and concepts before digitizing the designs.</p>

            <img src="yiliImages/Sketches_yili.png" alt="Sketch images">

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1white largeheadermargin">Wireframes</h3>

            <p class="p2white">Once I had established how the layout could look, I added more details to the sketches by creating mid-fidelity wireframes. This allowed me to improve the layout as well as concentrate on creating a hierarchy and visual consistent before focusing on the UI-design and styling. Through the design I tried to add elements that addressed the users needs and product goals. For example, I created responsive wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile to make sure users have a good experience on different devices.</p>


            <img src="./yiliImages/Responive wireframes.png" alt="Image mid-fi prototype">

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1white largeheadermargin">Mid-fi Prototype</h3>

            <p class="p2white">By creating prototypes for the mid-fi design I could simulates the user experience and test its usability. This allows us to identify and fix potential issues with the design before putting to much time and resources into the design (this will be discussed in the next section). </p>

        <div class="safetymain">
            <h2 class="rubrik p1dark">5. Test</h2>

            <p class="p2dark">Once the mid-fidelity prototype was created it was time to conduct usability testing to identify issues and gather feedback from the users. The findings will be used to make improvements to the design before moving on to creating the final design.</p>

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1dark headermargin">Usability testing</h3>

            <p class="p2dark">I conducted usability testing using the "think aloud" method to observe customers' user experience and identify any issues with the website. The testing was performed in person on four individuals, who were initially informed that the test was meant to assess the website and not their personal abilities, as well as the task they were required to complete. All participants were asked to perform 5 scenarios, while I took notes on their behaviour, difficulties, and thoughts. Below, you will find examples of the task, findings, and actions taken to improve the design.</p>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Tasks/errands</h4>
            <ul class="p2dark bulletlistsection">
                <li>You are planning to have lunch with some friends and want to book a table that can accommodate all of you. Call the restaurant and reserve a table for 4 people.</li>
                <li>After a long day at work, you are too tired to cook. Find out how to order and pay for a meal online.</li>
                <li>You are searching for a restaurant that you would like to visit. Browse freely through the restaurant's menu and any other optional information to see if you want to go there and eat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Major Findings</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark bulletlistsection">
                <li>User wanted to know how many items where in the shopping cart</li>
                <li>User wanted to know that an item was added to the shopping cart</li>
                <li>User wanted to know what was ordered when payment was done</li>
                <li>User wanted to a map that shows where the restaurant was located</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Improvements</h4>

            <ul class="p2dark bulletlistsection">
                <li>Added a number count when items were added to the shopping cart</li>
                <li>Added an popup icon when the order was added to the shopping cart</li>
                <li>User wanted to a map that shows where the restaurant was located</li>
                <li>Added a clear order summary</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="underrubirk p1dark headermargin">Final Product</h3>

            <p class="p1dark">After conducting usability testing and identifying issues and possible improvements I moved on to creating the final product. This included implementing the improvements and focusing on the visual aspects of the website. When it comes to visual design of something new I like to take my time to explore the different options and get the information right. This can take time as I want to ensure that the design not only is visually appealing but also fits the brand and sends the right tone to the users. To achieve this, I explored styles and patterns on platforms like Dribbble and created a moodboard before incorporating them into the final design.</p>

            <h4 class="h4rubrik p1dark h4headermargin">Moodboard</h4>

            <img src="yiliImages/Moodboard.png" alt="Image of moodboard">

            <h4 class="underrubirk p1dark largeheadermargin">Prototype</h4>

            <p class="p2dark">Finally, I made an interactive prototype in Figma by using the high-fi wireframes that had been created.</p>

            <p class="p2dark">In conclusion, I am happy with how the final product turned out and I have learned more about conducting user research, prototyping, and usability testing in the design process. I believe the final product will have a positive impact on the user experience for YiLi customers. While there always will be room for improvement, I believe the project has successfully achieved its goals.</p>
